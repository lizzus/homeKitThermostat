# homeKitThermostat
This is a Apple HomeKit thermostat with SSD1306 display and three buttons,
with which you can adjust the temperature up / down.
The third button is to change the mode and reset the homeKit configuration.
This thermostat communicates wirelessly with Arduino via nRF24L01.
Attach a relay to the arduino to control the heater or cooler.
- The thermostat receives feedback from the relay of the heater and displays on the screen whether the heating is working.

This project is still being developed and improved, and any recommendations would be useful.
